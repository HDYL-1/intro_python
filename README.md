# intro_python
Notebooks for Python beginners with emphasis on physics. No previous experience required, though familiriaty with basic college-level physics will help. 
Intended for Berkeley physics undergrads (sophomores/juniors).

The intended order of the notebooks is:
1. `Intro to Python.ipynb`
2. `Intro to numerics.ipynb`
3. `Intro to stats.ipynb` (not finished)

You should clone this repo (or download it), and launch the [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For more information see the first notebook.

## This is NOT supposed to be a comprehensive guide to all numerical coding in Python. 
## This series of notebooks is intended to
- introduce you to concepts and paradigms that are commonly used when programming
- introduce you to the syntax and quirks of Python and NumPy
- give you a rough idea of the advantages and limitations of numerical computation
- convince you of the power/utility of numerics
- show you how to use some commonly used techniques and tools
- help you get over the intial intimidation of learning how to code
- force you to learn how to read documentation, and help you get over the fear of unknown packages
- give you the ability and confidence to solve new problems yourself

(Berkeley is adding a coding component to its core undergrad program, so we need something like this to refer students to.)

## What I need feedback on
- How long does it take? How many sittings/sessions?
- Can someone for whom `computer==browser` understand everything? (Where do I need to add comments?)
- Content (Is something too tedious/unnecessary/skippable? Is there something else you think would be cool to include?)
- Can any of the code be improved? (faster, more beautiful/Pythonic, etc.)
- General comments (did you learn anything from it, did you enjoy it, etc.)
- All the text in red is comments/questions that will be removed before production, please comment/reply on the red texts.
- Mistakes or dubious claims of any kind
